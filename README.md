# Handwriting Detection OCR

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8+-blue.svg)
![OpenCV](https://img.shields.io/badge/opencv-4.x-orange.svg)
![Tesseract](https://img.shields.io/badge/tesseract-5+-green.svg)

A Python-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system for extracting handwritten text from images with accuracy measurement.

## Features

- 📷 Image preprocessing for better OCR results
- ✍️ Handwritten text extraction using Tesseract OCR
- 📊 Accuracy evaluation metrics (character-level)
- 🖼️ Supports JPG, PNG image formats
- 📂 Sample test images included

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. Install [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)
   ```bash
   # On Ubuntu
   sudo apt install tesseract-ocr
   
   # On Windows (via Chocolatey)
   choco install tesseract
   ```

2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python pytesseract numpy
   ```

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/subh117/handwriting-detection.git
   cd handwriting-detection
   ```

## Usage

1. Place your images in the `images/` folder
2. Run the OCR script:
   ```bash
   python ocr_handwriting.py
   ```
3. View results in terminal:
   ```

## Customization

- To improve accuracy, modify preprocessing in `ocr_handwriting.py`:
  ```python
  # Adjust these parameters
  gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
  blur = cv2.GaussianBlur(gray, (5,5), 0)
  ```

## Results
